# I work weekends at a Dairy Queen making ice-cream. I love looking at the weights of the different ice-creams that get served out compared to their actual weight. 
# This was the motivation for the project. I wanted to see which employee was most efficent looking at weights. 
# Data was collected in a rush over five days to meet the deadline. Weather affects the amount of people ordering ice cream. If you were in San Antonio during the past
# week, you know it was dark and cloudy. I think this affected my low medium and large observations. There was also a $.75 small cone sale during this time as well. 
# I'm assuming this contributed to seeing more small measurements than others. I purchased a new scale that recorded ounces to the nearest tenth to avoid any instrument error. 
# The scale at work was not digital like the new one i purchased, and had many ticks that made it hard to read at first glance. The new scale should avoid seeing many .5's or
# whole numbers. I made sure to let the people on ice-cream duty to pretend the new scale and paper with their measurements were not there; this would have caused internal
# bias to make better cones.
